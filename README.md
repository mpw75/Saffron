Golden stigmas of the Autumn crocus plant are native to Greece and have been introduced most successfully in Spain, Morocco, Italy, Iran, India, and Turkey. [^1]

## Growth Preferences and Descriptions
Family/Genus/Species: Iridaceae/Crocus/C. sativus

Crocus sativus sprouts 4-6 inches high from a corm 2-4 inches below the surface. The plants should be grown 3-4 inches apart. The bulb produces a small stalk that is pale yellow in color, wrapped in green grassy leaves. At the top, lilac teacup shaped petals bloom and shelter 3 amber colored Saffron stigma that poke beyond the bloom. 

The plant thrives in medium moisture soils with drainage and grow best in sunny or partially shaded spaces. The flowers curl at night and re-bloom in the morning and good weather. [^3]


## Abundance and Reproduction
_Crocus sativus_ corms are sterile due to domestic cultivation and require manual fertilization but because of the high value associated with the spice crop, approximately $5,000 per lb, Saffron is grown on an industrial scale. [^4]

## _In situ_
Saffron is used for medicinal and aesthetic purposes and can be used to season food, dye cloth a vibrant gold color, strengthen henna paste, color cosmetic products and scent perfume. Frescoes from akotiri depict Saffron henna tattoos and Linear B tablets from Knossos mark the presence of Saffron in the ancient economy. 

Dried saffron is very fragile and due to its arid environment is not likely to be found in an Archaeobotanical context. It would be more likely to find corm samples if they were carbonized or preserved due to a traumatic incident. [^8]

## Seasonality 
_Crocus sativus_ flowers in late August and early September. Long dry summers are most suitable for a successful autumn harvest. Another reason why Saffron is so valuable is because it can only be harvested once a year. [^3]

## Nutrition/ Health Benefits
Saffron stigmas and essential oils from crocus petals can be added to food for antioxidant/ anti-inflammatory uses. The stigmas are the prized part of the plant and can be soaked to release mild healing properties. [^6]

## Domestication Information 
The story of Saffron's domestication is highly contested but the leading theory posits that it originates from Greece and its closest relatives are _C. cartwrightianus_ and _C. pallasii subsp. pallasii_ and other wild Crocus species that are becoming increasingly rare. Crocus sativus is likely a triploid crossbreed of _C. cartwrightianus_ and _C. pallasii subsp. pallasii_. [^7]

## Plant usage
Saffron is normally steeped in warm water, butter or milk into a flavoring additive for larger dishes. It can also be steeped to make dye and other pigments. 
## Recipe Suggestion
Madhur Jaffrey's Saffron Rice 
1. Place the saffron on a piece of foil. Fold some of the foil over the saffron and crush it with a rolling pin or wooden potato masher. Put the crushed saffron in a small cup. Add the hot milk, cardamom, and sugar. Mix with a toothpick or the handle of a small spoon and set aside for 3 hours.
2. Put the rice in a bowl and wash in several changes of water. Drain, add fresh water to cover generously, and leave to soak for 30 minutes. Drain.
3. Pour the ghee in a heavy, lidded pan that will just hold the cooked rice comfortably and set over medium heat. When the ghee is hot, put in the cinnamon sticks. Stir for 10 seconds, then add the rice. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the rice around until the grain looks translucent, about 2 minutes. Add 2 2/3 cups of water and the salt. Bring to a boil. Cover. Reduce the heat to very, very low and cook for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat. Lift the lid and quickly dribble the saffron milk in any haphazard pattern. Quickly cover again and leave for 10 minutes. Mix the rice very delicately with a slotted spoon before serving. [^9]

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.
