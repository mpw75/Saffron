Golden stigmas of the Autumn crocus plant are native to Greece and have been introduced most successfully in Spain, Morocco, Italy, Iran, India, and Turkey. [^1]

## Growth Preferences and Descriptions
_Crocus sativus sprouts 4-6 inches high from a corm 2-4 inches below the surface. The plants should be grown 3-4 inches apart. The bulb produces a small stalk that is pale yellow in color, wrapped in green grassy leaves. At the top, lilac teacup shaped petals bloom and shelter 3 amber colored Saffron stigma that poke beyond the bloom. 

The plant thrives in medium moisture soils with drainage and grow best in sunny or partially shaded spaces. Long dry summers are most suitable for a successful autumn harvest. The flowers curl at night and re-bloom in the morning and good weather. [^3]


## Abundance and Reproduction
_Crocus sativus_ corms are sterile due to domestic cultivation and require manual fertilization but because of the high value associated with the spice crop, approximately $5,000 per lb, Saffron is grown on an industrial scale. [^4]
